# Cat-vs-Dog-Image-Classifier-using-TensorFlow-and-Keras
  This repository contains a simple image classification project built with TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained      on the Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset, allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen images.
